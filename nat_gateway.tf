# NAT Gateway (single, shared across all 3 AZs)
#
# NOTE: NAT Gateway IS a zonal resource in Azure. Deploying it without a
# "zones" argument places it in "no zone" (regional, non-zonal), which is
# the typical choice when sharing one NAT Gateway across multiple AZs - if
# you pin it to a single zone (e.g. zones = ["1"]) and that zone fails, the
# other AZs lose outbound connectivity through this NAT Gateway.
#
# For true zonal resilience, deploy one NAT Gateway per AZ (zones = ["1"],
# ["2"], ["3"]) and associate each with only that AZ's public subnet.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Public IP for the NAT Gateway (this is what provides "Internet Gateway"-like
# connectivity - in Azure, Internet access is a property of the public IP,
# not a separate gateway object attached to the VNet)

# Internet, the closest equivalent to an AWS Internet Gateway route),
# combined with resources in those subnets holding Public IPs.
