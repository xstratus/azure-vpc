# ============================================================================
# Route Tables (UDRs)
#
# Added for explicit, auditable routing instead of relying purely on Azure's
# implicit system routes. See README.md "Routing" section for the full
# explanation of how each tier reaches (or is blocked from) the Internet.
#
# IMPORTANT - NAT Gateway as next hop:
# Azure NAT Gateway CANNOT be referenced as a next_hop_type in a UDR. The
# only way for a subnet to route outbound traffic through a NAT Gateway is
# a direct subnet <-> NAT Gateway association (azurerm_subnet_nat_gateway_
# association). That association itself injects the effective "0.0.0.0/0 ->
# NAT Gateway" route - it cannot be expressed as a UDR route entry.
#
# Therefore:
#   - rt-public: explicit 0.0.0.0/0 -> Internet. This is the closest
#     equivalent to an AWS Internet Gateway route table entry - resources in
#     these subnets reach the Internet directly via their Public IPs.
#   - rt-app: no 0.0.0.0/0 UDR entry. Outbound-to-Internet for the App tier
#     is provided by associating the shared NAT Gateway to the App subnets
#     (see nat_gateway.tf). The route table here exists for VNet-local
#     routing visibility and future custom routes (e.g. forced tunneling to
#     a firewall).
#   - rt-data: explicit 0.0.0.0/0 -> None, blocking all Internet egress as a
#     defense-in-depth measure independent of NSG rules.
